== Broken
- unicode char top left corner, dockerimage icon in NvimTree
- `^xn ^xn` complete 2/3 words seems to be \~broken
- `^p` completion without any visible menu doesn't work
- python indentation broken because of TS highlight
- `:term` doesn't split window
- after `ciw` confirm with enter from completion, `.` won't repeat
- `Session.vim` went into wrong folder
- duplicate symbols in cmdline, e.g. `:h''spr` => raise issue?
- fzf install issues (lazy.nvim) !!! (`unset https_proxy` fixes it?)

== Workarounds
- zsh snippets ft wrong because # defines a zsh shebang, https://github.com/SirVer/ultisnips/issues/1520
- `se dg` still no luck: problem caused by both nvim cmp and lualine plugins, got `yok` now

== New features + ideas
- `EHelp`, `ELocalHelp`, `EScript`, ...
- `Quotes` with `!` or argument to change surround delimiter (e.g. use backticks)
- `goX`, `coc`, `=oc`, `db`..., use in mappings + find all free mappings:
- add `alt-.` in cmdline and `c-y` to paste
- redefine command `G` with `:vert Git -p`
- TS info in statusline
- ulti, show my snippets only
- undo, redo without jumping
- no whitespace removing if not my file?
- `\w` -> `:w` if no path
- `ls!` unlisted help buffers, include in `<leader>b`?
- `gK` for help, test it still works with `'wrap`

== Plugins
- undo tree plugin?

== Test
- TS text objects: test selections
- check new fold logic

== Questions
- install dictionaries?
- jinja2 syntax? TS inject in ansible buffers?
- ask in weechat - disable map for one go
